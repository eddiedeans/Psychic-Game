# Psychic-Game
# Welcome to my first JS game

## To play this game visit this link https://eddiedeans.github.io/Psychic-Game/

### This game demonstrates my understanding of vanilla Javascript. To play the game you guess a letter A-Z. Your have limited guess before you have to start over. You can see Wins and Losses get incremented each time the games end. When you guess the letter correctly then an alert will appear and show you the random letter the computer chose.
